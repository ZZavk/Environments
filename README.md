# Environments
VR Game for the Meta Quest 2 or 3 where you can relax and look at different "environments".

Dont forget that this is a game in development. Bugs and glitches may appear very often.
We are also searching for game developers and other people.

Here's what we are planing for release, for updates, and for Addons:
  - At least 6 Enviornments (Release)
  - Different Spots to stand or sit in, in these Enviornments (Release)

  - Multiplayer Communication (Update)

  - Addons for different Enviornments (City's, Mountains and stuff like that)
